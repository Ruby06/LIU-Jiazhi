## Part 1: Data
Reasoning for generabizability - random sampling was used.  Any reservations should be well justified.
Correct reasoning for causality â€“ random assignment was used in this project.
The data set is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released around 2016.
Some of these variables are only there for informational purposes and do not make any sense to include in a statistical analysis.
actor1 through actor5 variables was used to determine whether the movie casts an actor or actress who won a best actor or actress Oscar.

## Part 2: Research question
Through analysis the rating score of several TV movies released in the same period but leads to different scores.
Figure out the main reason of the results.

## Part 3: Exploratory data analysis
makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
 m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
  x <<- y
  m <<- NULL
  }
 get <- function() x
 setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
  setmean = setmean,
  getmean = getmean)

## Part 4: Modeling
Insert a new code chunk
title <- Dead of summer {
  title_type <-  TV Movie
  genre <- Mystery & Suspense
  runtime <- 60min
  thtr_rel_year <- 2016
}
imdb_rating <- 6.3
imdb_num_votes <- 110
top200_box: Whether or not the movie is in the Top 200 Box Office list on BoxOfficeMojo (no)
actor1 <- Elizabeth Mitchell 
actor2 <- Alberto Frezza 
imdb_url <- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5210998/?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=&pf_rd_r=0R0YAEBBSE1DS2GH8J0R&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_t=51501&pf_rd_i=&ref_=il_tl_li_tt

## Part 5: Prediction

cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
 m <- x$getmean()
if(!is.null(m)) {
  message("getting cached data")
  return(m)
 }
 data <- x$get()
 m <- mean(data, ...)
 x$setmean(m)
 m

## Part 6: Conclusion
The shortcoming of this TV movie is there are no so famous movie stars in it which leads to the lower rating campared to other movies
in the same period after the linear analysis.
So I suggest main actors and actresses are two main reasons for a movie according to the research on IMDB.
